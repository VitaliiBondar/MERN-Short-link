# MERN-Short-link
### This app shortens your links, and you can see how many times someone has clicked on the link

This is a simple application to show interaction frontend with backend


Okay, let's just say a few words about technology
#### FrontEnd
I did not pay attention to layout, i just show the interaction of different technologies
* react hooks
* context
* materialize-css
* react-router-dom
#### Backend
* express
* mongoose
* express-validator
* jsonwebtoken
* bcryptjs
* shortid
#### And some things to simplify development
* concurrently
* cross-env
* nodemon
## Okay lets start
* clone this repository "git clone https://github.com/VitaliiBondar/MERN-Short-link.git"
* in the root folder you must install some modules
  * npm install
  * npm run client:install
* and start app -  "npm run dev"
